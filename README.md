# What a Week, Huh? Watch Face

This repository contains all the files from a
[Watch Face Studio](https://developer.samsung.com/watch-face-studio/overview.html)
project for a Pixel Watch face based on the "What a Week, Huh?" meme.

To use this project, download the entire repo as a zip file, then rename it from
`.zip` to `.wfs`. This will allow you to open it in Watch Face Studio and
install it onto a device.

For more details, see my
[blog post](http://beehive.gay/blog/2023/11/21/making-a-pixel-watch-face) about
how I created this watch face.
